  VARIABLE VOLTAGE â€“ FREQUENCY CONTROL: changing the supply frequency the speed of the motor can be controlled.  
  To avoid saturation of motor the terminal voltage is also changed along with the frequency (V/F control).  
  This is effectively done by a converter-inverter combination using power electronics switching devices. 
  This developed torque by induction motor.

  STATOR VOLTAGE CONTROL: Developed torque in case of induction motor is proportional
  to the square of terminal voltage at a constant value of the supply frequency and the slip. 
  When the applied voltage with constant frequency is varied for constant torque slip varies 
  inversely to the voltage.
